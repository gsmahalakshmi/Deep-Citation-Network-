concluding remarks

it has been shown in this paper that by putting the heterotic green-schwarz super-

string on an n=(2,0) super-worldsheet, rather than on an ordinary worldsheet, two major

problems are solved.after this simplication, the light-cone

methods were successfully used to calculate neveu-schwarz-ramond scattering amplitudes

with an arbitrary number of loops and an arbitrary number of external neveu-schwarz

bosons.14,15

in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formalism, polyakovs ansatz can also be used to eval-

uate superstring scattering amplitudes.the covariant method on an ordinary worldsheet

in 1984, green and schwarz discovered a lorentz-covariant action on an ordinary

worldsheet for the green-schwarz superstring that had enough classical symmetries to be

able to be gauge-xed to the free light-cone action.6 for the ten-dimensional heterotic

green-schwarz superstring, this action is:

z d d{

1

det e

[



+ + em

 pmp] + i x(

)  ix( 

)}, (iii.a.1)

 is the two-dimensional vielbein (m is either  or ), 
  + 

where em
so(9,1) gamma-matrices satisfying the cyclic identity 
  = 0,

), and in two-dimensional minkowski space,    +  and
  em
     are the worldsheet coordinates, + and  are the tangent-space coordinates, x
is a real so(9,1) vector,  is a real so(9,1) chiral spinor, and p are the 32 real so(9,1)

 are the symmetric
  + 

 (mx  im

scalars that parameterize the self-dual lattice of the heterotic string.it will be interesting to see how

the sum over spin structures in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formalism is replaced in the

green-schwarz formalism (note that on an n=(2,0) surface, the discrete spin structures

of an n=1 surface are replaced by the continuous u(1) moduli)38. perhaps the biggest

problem will be understanding how to describe the subset of punctured n=(2,0) super-

riemann surfaces that correspond to light-cone super-worldsheets.(2) green,m.b.(6) green,m.b.the covariant superparticle action on an n=2 super-worldline

the superparticle on both an n=1 and n=2 super-worldline was rst discovered

by sorokin, tkach, and volkov in 1989.28 although they considered three and four-

dimensional target spaces,

it is straightforward to generalize their results to a ten-

dimensional target space.19,29 instead of starting from the usual action for the massless

18

particle, r d [a x x], they started from an action containing bosonic spinors that

closely resemble the twistor variables of penrose30.at the present time, only the heterotic version of the green-schwarz covariant action

is able to be dened on n=2 super-riemann surfaces.the second half of the paper will discuss the polyakov method for evaluating heterotic

green-schwarz scattering amplitudes.it will rst be shown that the ten-dimensional

covariant green-schwarz action on an ordinary riemann surface contains a conformal

anomaly in the semi-light-cone gauge.10 it will next be shown how to dene the covariant

heterotic green-schwarz superstring action on an n=(2,0) super-riemann surface (this

n=(2,0) action for the heterotic green-schwarz superstring was rst dened by tonin18,

who relied heavily on earlier work done by sorokin, tkach, volkov, and zheltukhin on the

4

superparticle19).besides elim-

inating the need to sum over spin structures, the spacetime supersymmetry of the green-

schwarz formalism considerably simplies the evaluation of superstring scattering ampli-

tudes involving external fermions.1

unfortunately, at the present time, there are only two methods for calculating green-

schwarz superstring scattering amplitudes, neither of which has been very productive.the light-cone method on an ordinary worldsheet

the light-cone method for the interacting green-schwarz superstring was rst intro-

duced by green and schwarz in 1982 to describe external strings with momenta p + = 0,1

and was later generalized by green, schwarz,2 and mandelstam3 to describe external

strings with arbitrary p +.in order to do this, one rst has to construct a lorentz-covariant

action for the heterotic green-schwarz superstring on an n=(2,0) super-worldsheet.the advantage of starting from this twistor-like action is that supersymmetrizing

the worldline produces the superparticle, rather than the spinning particle.i. introduction

the green-schwarz formalism for the superstring has the advantage over the neveu-

schwarz-ramond formalism of being manifestly spacetime supersymmetric.once the superparticle action on an n=2 super-worldline has been constructed, it is

straightforward to generalize to the heterotic green-schwarz superstring on an n=(2,0)

super-worldsheet (although the superparticle action on an n=1 super-worldline can also

be generalized to a heterotic green-schwarz superstring action on an n=(1,0) super-

worldsheet,33 this action does not allow the correct periodicity conditions for the green-

schwarz elds, and it suers from a conformal anomaly like the action on an ordinary

worldsheet).there are two problems that occur with this light-cone method on ordinary world-

sheets, either in the green-schwarz or in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formalism.3

in this paper,

it will be shown that by replacing the ordinary two-dimensional

worldsheet of the heterotic green-schwarz superstring action17 with an n=(2,0) super-

worldsheet, the problems with both the light-cone and covariant methods in the green-

schwarz formalism can be solved as they were in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formal-

ism.with these n=(2,0) super-virasoro constraints, it should be possible to use standard

brst quantization techniques to calculate scattering amplitudes16 and to construct a

second-quantized eld theory36,37 for the heterotic green-schwarz superstring.
