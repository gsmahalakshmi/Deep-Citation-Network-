c: particles and fields, 51, 627 (1991).this
is related to the fact that each generator g of a lie algebra is a primitive element,
i.e.this possibility, realized by using a contraction pro-
cedure [4,5], results in a meaningful tool for the description of problems with a
fundamental length scale.likewise, the dierential operator in (2) gives a realization
of the casimir invariant of the pseudoeuclidean quantum algebra eq(1, 1) [4] with
q = eia and real a , which in its own right can be considered the kinematical
symmetry of the discrete system.faddeev, algebra and anal-
ysis 1, 193 (1990).even the coalgebra plays a fundamental physical role as it establishes
the rules for combining single phonons into composite systems.the composition of the momenta shows that the umklapp process is implied
by the quantum group symmetry.in this letter we show that the qdeformed pseudoeuclidean algebra eq(1, 1)
[4] arises quite naturally as kinematical symmetry of phonon propagation in har-
monic crystals, whose lattice spacing is interpreted as the dimensional deformation
parameter.it has also been shown that the quantum geometry associated to
the action of qdeformed groups on quantum spaces can be given by means of
q-dierence operators [3].here we analyze the case with m = 0, which describes the phonons.let us show how the coproduct can be brought to bear to the study of the
fusion of phonons.we conclude by observing that the very same procedure can be applied to
the interaction of any number of phonons.phonons with their symmetries as well as multiphonon processes are derived

from the quantum group structure.32, 1159 (1991);

tum groups, proceedings of the rst semester on quantum groups, eds.the quantum deformed (1 + 1) poincare algebra is shown to be the kine-

matical symmetry of the harmonic chain, whose spacing is given by the deformation

just from their early setting it has been observed the anity of quantum
groups with nite dierence calculus [1] and the presence of qformulas in the
realizations of these new algebras has laid the ground for a theory of qspecial
functions [2].koelink, on quantum groups and qspecial function, ph.d. thesis, (lei-

(1991).inhomogeneous quantum groups are thus proposed

as kinematical invariance of discrete systems.
