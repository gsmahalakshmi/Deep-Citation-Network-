the charges qm,m act analogously on the  tachyons.[1, 2], while in the continuum

approach they have been known for a long time [3].[5-8], while

now that we have determined how the charges act on the vertex operators, we

can derive powerful constraints on the correlation functions.finally, we note that all the above formulae can be modied for the  tachyons

by a simple parity ip., kn+1 >= fm+n,m(ki)|k > ,

k = m +

ki .these physical states, that

are present only for quantized values of momentum, are the remnants of transverse

string excitations [4].to complete
the ward identity, we need to consider the action of qm,m on t  which, by the
sum rules, carries momentum p =  1
2 (n  1).this

encourages us to believe that all the correlation functions are determined by the

symmetries of the theory.in this fashion, as expected, the

symmetry between the xed and moving vertex operators is restored, and each one

introduces the factor 2k + 2m into the ward identity.in this paper i derive

the symmetry ward identities and show how they determine the non-vanishing

tachyon correlation functions.the ward identities can be rephrased in a fock space notation for tachyons.i will restrict myself to the non-compact closed

string case and to the bulk correlation functions that satisfy the energy sum rule

[4, 11].thus, the (n, 1) amplitudes are determined by

the ward identities for the virasoro subalgebra (11).they appear, somewhat surprisingly, in the two-dimensional

string model and make it quite non-trivial.
